rustc-host = "0.1"
```

after that you can use it like this:

```rust
extern crate rustc_host;

fn main() {
    let host_triple = rustc_host::from_cli()
        .expect("failed to get host triple from rustc");
    println!("host triple: {}", host_triple);
}
```

## Usage as a binary

### Installation

```console
cargo install rustc-host
```

### Usage

```console
rustc-host
```

#### Example output

```text
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

## Features

* `unsafe` - disabled by default, enables unsafe code that reuses the `String`
buffer obtained from `rustc -Vv` instead of allocating a new one.
